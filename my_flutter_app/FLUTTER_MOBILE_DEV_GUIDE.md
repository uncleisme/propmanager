## Key Flutter Mobile Features Demonstrated

### 1. **Navigation**
- Bottom navigation bar with 3 tabs
- Smooth tab switching with `IndexedStack`
- Material Design navigation patterns

### 2. **State Management**
- `StatefulWidget` for dynamic content
- `setState()` for UI updates
- Data passing between widgets

### 3. **Mobile UI Components**
- `AppBar` with elevation and theming
- `Card` widgets for content grouping
- `ListView.builder` for dynamic lists
- `TextField` for user input
- `Checkbox` for interactive controls
- `FloatingActionButton` for primary actions

### 4. **Responsive Design**

- `Column` and `Row` for layouts
- `Expanded` and `Flexible` for responsive sizing
- Proper padding and spacing

## Running the App

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK installed (✅ Done)
- Dart SDK included with Flutter (✅ Done)

### Commands
```bash
# Navigate to the project
cd my_flutter_app

# Add Flutter to PATH
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/flutter/bin"

# Check for issues
flutter analyze

# Run on available device/simulator
flutter run

# For web development (if Chrome is available)
flutter run -d chrome

# For desktop development (requires additional setup)
flutter run -d linux
```

## Development Workflow in Cursor

### 1. **Code Intelligence**
- Cursor provides excellent Dart/Flutter autocomplete
- Real-time error detection and suggestions
- Import management and code formatting

### 2. **Hot Reload**
- Make changes to your Dart code
- Save the file
- Flutter automatically updates the running app
- State is preserved during hot reload

### 3. **Debugging**
- Use `print()` statements for simple debugging
- Flutter DevTools integration available
- Rich error messages and stack traces

## Mobile Development Capabilities

### Supported Platforms
- ✅ **Android** (requires Android SDK setup)
- ✅ **iOS** (requires Xcode on macOS)
- ✅ **Web** (runs in browser)
- ✅ **Desktop** (Linux, Windows, macOS)

### Next Steps for Mobile Development

#### For Android Development:
1. Install Android Studio
2. Set up Android SDK
3. Create Android emulator or connect physical device
4. Run: `flutter run -d android`

#### For iOS Development (macOS only):
1. Install Xcode
2. Set up iOS simulator
3. Run: `flutter run -d ios`

#### For Web Development:
1. Install Chrome browser
2. Run: `flutter run -d chrome`

## Project Structure
```
my_flutter_app/
├── lib/
│   └── main.dart          # Main app code
├── android/               # Android-specific code
├── ios/                   # iOS-specific code
├── web/                   # Web-specific code
├── linux/                 # Linux desktop code
├── windows/               # Windows desktop code

├── test/                  # Unit tests
└── pubspec.yaml          # Dependencies and configuration
```

## Adding Dependencies
Edit `pubspec.yaml` to add packages:
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  http: ^1.1.0           # For API calls
