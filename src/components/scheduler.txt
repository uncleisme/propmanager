Absolutely — what you're describing is a job assignment and scheduling system where property managers can:

Create jobs (e.g., plumbing fix, inspection)

Assign them to technicians

Schedule them for a specific date/time

Easily reschedule (drag & drop) as needed

This combines task scheduling with resource (technician) management and calendar UI.

✅ Suggested Solution: Scheduler Module for Technician Job Assignment
🔧 1. Core Features You Need
Feature	Description
Job creation	Define tasks like repairs, inspections, cleaning
Calendar view	Visual schedule of all jobs (drag & drop enabled)
Technician availability	Show when each tech is busy/free
Assignment logic	Assign jobs to technicians manually (or automatically)
Reminders	Notify technicians via email/app notification
Rescheduling	Drag job to new time slot or technician

🛠️ 2. Recommended Architecture
📦 Backend
Stack: Node.js / Python / PHP — whatever your backend is

Database: Store job records, status, technician availability

Scheduler Engine:

Use cron-based task runner (e.g., node-cron, Celery, Agenda.js)

Queue system (e.g., Redis + BullMQ) to dispatch reminders

🧠 Logic
Check for technician availability

Allow scheduling conflicts only with override

Mark jobs as pending, in progress, complete

🖼️ Frontend
Calendar UI:

Use FullCalendar.js or react-big-calendar

Allows drag-and-drop of jobs

Each row = technician, columns = time slots

Job Card:

Drag from unassigned list to a tech's calendar

Supports edit, reschedule, delete

Example Flow
Manager creates job (e.g., “Fix leak in Apt 204” for July 24, 10 AM)

Job appears in unassigned pool

Manager drags job to technician’s schedule

System:

Saves assignment

Sends notification to tech

Adds job to technician's mobile/web view

If job is moved, system re-schedules notifications
